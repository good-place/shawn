# shawn 

Reactive streams for Janet programming language.

Goal is to have something like `funcool/potok` but without all the RX cruft.

## Usage

Right now only code is in the `/example` directory. Run it with:

```
janet example/init.janet
```

You will be presented with command prompt, type `h` for help on other commands.


## TODOs

- [ ] @todo write down philosophy and tech
- [ ] @todo refactor
- [ ] @todo make fiber based only?
